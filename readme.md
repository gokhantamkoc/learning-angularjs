## **What is Angular.js?**

In web development, HTML defines the page structure. The page structure can be carved with **Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)** in order to present a more stylish and readable web page to users. JavaScript adds dynamic functionality to the web page structure so that users see some color, animation, graphical effects, data manipulation etc.

Coding JavaScript is a challenging concept. Especially, when trying to develop a single page application. There are libraries which are trying to minimize and organize the usage of JavaScript. ``Angular.js`` is one of the most popular JavaScript libraries. ``Angular.js`` extends the HTML vocabulary and organizes JavaScript code. In addition, ``Angular.js`` is compatible with **jQuery**.

## **Important Points**

Angular.js has four major concepts:

- Directives: HTML attributes/annotations which activates a JavaScript behavior.
- Modules: Collection of web page components.
- Controllers: Represents application behavior.
- Expressions: Defines how to display data.
